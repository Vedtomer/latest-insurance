        <h3>Here are some things included in this package</h3>
        <p>While I can provide information on the general factors that influence Auto insurance pricing, including the various elements considered in premium calculations, I don't have specific details on the historical pricing packages of individual insurance companies. Pricing strategies, packages, and premium rates can change over time based on factors such as market conditions, regulatory changes, and the financial performance of the insurance company. Insurance companies assess the level of risk associated with the policyholder. Factors like the driver's age, driving record, type of vehicle, and usage patterns can impact the premium.</p>
        <p>The type and extent of coverage selected by the policyholder affect the premium. More comprehensive coverage or higher coverage limits often result in higher premiums. The amount of the deductible chosen by the policyholder can impact the premium. Higher deductibles generally result in lower premiums</p>
        <p>Overall market conditions, including the supply and demand for auto insurance products, can influence pricing. Changes in regulations and laws can affect auto insurance pricing and the availability of certain coverage options. An individual's credit score may be used as a factor in determining auto insurance premiums</p>
        <p>If you're interested in the historical pricing packages of a specific insurance company, I recommend contacting the company directly or checking their official documents, such as annual reports or financial disclosures, which may provide insights into changes in pricing and packages over time.</p>
